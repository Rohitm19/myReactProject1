className: 
An attribute used to specify a CSS class. This applies to all regular DOM and SVG elements like <div>, <a> & others.

Props:
React allows us to pass information to a Component using something called props (stands for properties).
Props are basically kind of global variable or object

useState:
useState is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components. You pass the initial state to this 
function and it returns a variable with the current state value (not necessarily the initial state) and another 
function to update this value.

Props are used to pass data, whereas state is for managing data. Data from props is read-only, and cannot be modified
by a component that is receiving it from outside. State data can be modified by its own component, 
but is private (cannot be accessed from outside).
